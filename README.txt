Hide Quests - 1.0

On my second playthrough, I hated how so many quests that I don't intend to complete cluttered up my quest log. So I developed this little mod that let's you hide and unhide quests in your journal. This is my first mod for Witcher 3, so it is a little rough around the edges.


:: REQUIREMENTS ::

- Witcher 3 4.0 (NGE)


:: FEATURES ::

- Hide/Unhide quests in the quest journal
- Sort quests by level in descending order (except finished and aborted quests)


:: INSTALLATION USING MODMANAGER ::

- As usual: Just add the downloaded archive via ModManager and use ScriptMerger to resolve any conflicts with other mods.
- Optional: Change default input binding for action "ToggleHideQuest" in your [Documents]\The Witcher 3\input.settings in the section [EMPTY_CONTEXT].

:: MANUAL INSTALLATION ::

- Copy modHideQuests to your [Witcher 3]/mods directory.
- Execute ScriptMerger to resolve any conflicts.
- Append contents of input.settings.part.txt to your [Documents]\The Witcher 3\input.settings.
- Optional: Change default input binding for action "ToggleHideQuest" in your [Documents]\The Witcher 3\input.settings in the section [EMPTY_CONTEXT].


:: KNOWN ISSUES ::

Quests will only be hidden/unhidden after reopening the quest journal.


:: USAGE ::

Hiding
- In the quest journal, select a quest and press the button that is bound to the action "ToggleHideQuest" (default: X/Triangle on your pad, or H on keyboard).
- A small popup will show indicating that the quest is now marked as hidden.
- If you close and reopen the quest journal, the quest will now show in the drop-down category called "hidden".

Unhiding
- Select the previously hidden quest in the "hidden" category and press the button for "ToggleHideQuest" to unhide the quest. 
- A small popup will show indicating that the quest is now marked as not-hidden.
- If you close and reopen the quest journal, the quest will now show in its original dropdown category, rather than under "hidden".
